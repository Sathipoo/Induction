                                Only at Arshith Fresh</strong></p>
                            <p>There’s something so familiar about the smell of groundnut oil hitting a hot pan.
                                It’s the beginning of a meal, a memory, a moment that feels like home.</p>
                            <p>At Arshith Fresh, we don’t just make groundnut oil — we revive a tradition.
                                The kind where seeds are crushed in wooden ghani mills, the oil is filtered without
                                machines, and the final product is so pure, it speaks for itself without saying a
                                word.</p>
                                <p>Come, let us show you how we make real cold-pressed groundnut oil — just like
                                    the old day.</p>

                                <h3>🌱 <strong>It All Starts With the Right Groundnuts</strong></h3>
                                <p>We source our native groundnuts from trusted farmers who grow them the
                                    traditional way — seasonally, patiently, and without shortcuts.</p>
                                <p>These are not hybrid, bulk-produced nuts. <br>
                                    They are small-batch harvested, carefully sun-dried, and cleaned thoroughly to
                                    remove any moisture or dirt.</p>
                                <p>Because we know — if the seed isn’t pure, the oil can never be.</p>

                                <h3>🛢 <strong>Pressed Slowly, Not Rushed</strong></h3>
                                <p>We use the cold-press (wooden chekku / mara chekku) method — one of the most
                                    ancient and trusted oil extraction techniques</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>The groundnuts are pressed at room temperature, without external heat</li>
                                        <li>A slow wooden pestle crushes the nuts, allowing oil to seep out naturally</li>
                                        <li>The process retains the original aroma, taste, color, and nutrients of the nut</li>
                                    </ul>
                                <p>This is not “refined” oil. <br>
                                    This is earthy, golden-brown oil with a slightly nutty fragrance and an honest,
                                    rustic flavor that enhances everything you cook.</p>

                                <h3>🧂 <strong>No Additions. No Tricks.</strong></h3>
                                <p>We don’t refine, bleach, or deodorize our oil.</p>
                                <p>We don’t mix palm oil. <br>
                                    We don’t treat it with heat or preservatives. <br>
                                    We don’t filter it to make it “look pretty.”</p>
                                <p>We just press, rest, hand-filter, and pack it as it is — with all its natural fiber and
                                    goodness intact.</p>

                                <h3>🍛 <strong> Why We Use It Every Day</strong></h3>
                                <p>In our homes, groundnut oil is the foundation for everything: </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>We use it for deep frying – bhajji, poori, and murukku come out perfectly
                                        crispy and light</li>
                                    <li>It gives a beautiful nutty aroma to simple dals and poriyals</li>
                                    <li>It’s excellent for pickles — because it doesn’t go rancid quickly</li>

                            <p>In every kitchen, there's an oil that defines the taste of home. For many of us, it's sunflower oil — light on the tongue, gentle on the stomach, and always comforting in a way we can't explain.</p>
                            <p>But not all sunflower oils are created equal. At Arshith Fresh, we've taken a simple seed and turned it into something pure — without refining, bleaching, or chemical treatment. Just clean, cold-pressed sunflower oil the way it's meant to be.</p>

                                <h3>🌻 <strong>It All Begins With the Seed</strong></h3>
                                <p>Our journey starts in the open sunlit fields of India, where golden yellow sunflowers bloom freely, soaking in the warmth of the sun.</p>
                                <p>The seeds from these flowers are harvested at peak ripeness, cleaned thoroughly, and never stored for long, so they retain their natural aroma, flavor, and nutrients.</p>
                                <p>These aren't factory-grade bulk seeds. They are carefully sourced in small batches to ensure every drop of oil we extract has purity at its heart.</p>

                                <h3>🛠 <strong>Cold-Pressed, Not Chemically Refined</strong></h3>
                                <p>● No external heat</p>
                                <p>● No solvents</p>
                                <p>● No refining</p>

                                <p>What you get is unrefined, cold-pressed sunflower oil — light yellow in color, with a soft nutty fragrance and a clean, neutral taste.</p>
                                <p>This is not just cooking oil — this is a gentle and honest fat that respects your food and your health.</p>

                                <p>● Add preservatives or anti-foaming agents</p>
                                <p>● Use high-heat refining that strips away nutrients</p>
                                <p>● Mix with palm or other low-grade oils</p>
                                <p>● Bleach or deodorize to "enhance" the look</p>
                                <p>What you're getting is 100% pure sunflower oil, just as nature intended.</p>

                                    <li>Used in traditional recipes like poori, bajji, or pakoda — where the oil lifts the flavor instead of masking it</li>

                                <p>And it's not just about cooking. Some of our customers even use it on their skin and hair for its lightness and Vitamin E richness.</p>

                            <p>In South Indian kitchens, some things are sacred.</p>
                            <p>One of them is nuvvula nune — sesame oil. Not just for cooking, but for healing, puja, rituals, pickles, and generations of good health.</p>
                            <p>Ask any grandmother and she'll say the same:</p>
                            <p>"If it's sesame oil, it should be thick, strong, and cold-pressed."</p>
                            <p>That's exactly what we offer at Arshith Fresh — pure, wood-pressed sesame oil, made just the way our elders believed in.</p>

                                <p>It starts with carefully chosen native sesame seeds, grown with care by trusted farmers. These aren't treated or tampered — they're harvested during the right season, dried under the sun, and stored in traditional sacks.</p>
                                <p>These black or white sesame seeds, rich in oil and aroma, are then cleaned gently to remove dust or debris.</p>
                                <p>We don't rush.</p>
                                <p>Because when you respect the seed, the oil respects your health.</p>

                                <h3>🛢 <strong>Wood-Pressed the Traditional Way (Chekku Nune)</strong></h3>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>● The sesame seeds are added to the wooden press and rotated slowly</li>
                                    <li>● No heat. No pressure. Just gentle, rhythmic crushing</li>
                                    <li>● A small amount of palm jaggery or dry ginger is sometimes added — to balance heat and enhance shelf life (as per tradition)</li>
                                    <li>● The oil slowly begins to flow — dark golden, thick, and aromatic</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>This process preserves the natural flavor, nutrients, and medicinal qualities of the sesame oil — something no refined oil can offer.</p>

                                <p>What you receive is 100% pure sesame oil — thick, earthy, slightly nutty in smell, and deep brown in color (if made from black seeds).</p>
                                <p>It may not look "factory perfect," but that's because it's real.</p>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>● We use it in pickles — because it keeps flavors intact for months</li>
                                    <li>● We start meals with a spoon of it in podi rice</li>
                                    <li>● We pour it for temple-style tamarind rice, puliyodarai, and pulusu</li>
                                    <li>● We use it to massage babies, elders, and ourselves — to improve circulation and calm the nerves</li>
                                    <li>● And yes, we light our lamps with it — because it's that sacred</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>This is not just a cooking oil.</p>
                                <p>It's a healing oil.</p>

                            <p>Long before pharmacies and packaged cosmetics, our grandparents had a remedy for almost everything — castor oil.</p>
                            <p>For digestion. For hair. For pain relief. For immunity.</p>
                            <p>They didn't ask why — they just trusted it.</p>

                                <h3>🌱 <strong>The Journey Begins with the Ricinus Seed</strong></h3>
                                <p>Our castor seeds come from native, high-oil-yielding castor plants, grown traditionally in dry regions of India by small farmers.</p>
                                <p>Once harvested, the seeds are sun-dried — not kiln-dried — to preserve the natural oil inside.</p>
                                <p>Then comes the process that truly defines Arshith Fresh:</p>
                                <p>We don't refine, bleach, or treat it with heat.</p>
                                <p>We go the old-school way.</p>
                                
                                <h3>🛢 <strong>Wood-Pressed, Not Factory Processed</strong></h3>
                                <p>Using the cold-pressed / wooden ghani method, the seeds are crushed slowly, allowing the oil to flow out gradually without losing any of its powerful nutrients.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>● No hexane</li>
                                    <li>● No industrial heat</li>
                                    <li>● No additives</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Just pure castor oil, thick, slightly sticky, golden to pale yellow, and filled with the original strength of the seed.</p>
                                <p>The oil is manually filtered, not over-processed — which means you may even notice a natural scent and texture. That's exactly how it's meant to be.</p>
                                
                                <h3>🚫 <strong>No Fragrance. No Dilution. No Nonsense.</strong></h3>
                                <p>We don't perfume our castor oil to mask its identity.</p>
                                <p>We don't mix mineral oil or paraffin to make it "lighter."</p>
                                <p>Why?</p>
                                <p>Because pure castor oil is not supposed to be light.</p>
                                <p>It's supposed to work.</p>

                                    <li>✔ Hair & Scalp: We mix it with coconut or sesame oil and apply it to the scalp to reduce hair fall, strengthen roots, and cool the head.</li>
                                    <li>✔ Joint Pain Relief: A warm castor oil massage followed by hot fermentation is a trusted home remedy for knee pain, backaches, and swelling.</li>
                                    <li>✔ Detox & Digestion: One or two teaspoons with warm water (under guidance) have been traditionally used for colon cleansing and relieving constipation.</li>
                                    <li>✔ Baby Care: Applied lightly to baby's navel and joints to support bone strength and digestion.</li>
                                    <li>✔ Cracked Heels & Dry Skin: Night application soothes and heals dry areas faster than any store-bought cream.</li>
                                    <li>✔ Puja Use: Castor oil is traditionally used in lighting deepams for auspicious rituals.</li>

                                <h3>🌴 <strong>Where It All Begins — The Coconut Grove</strong></h3>
                                <p>We source our coconuts directly from naturally grown groves in South India — where the trees grow tall, the air is salty and clean, and the soil is full of life.</p>
                                <p>Only mature, fully ripened coconuts are chosen — the kind with thick, white flesh and high oil content.</p>
                                <p>No immature harvesting. No hybrid shortcuts.</p>
                                <p>Because real flavor comes from waiting.</p>
                                
                                <h3>🥣 <strong>Cold-Processed Without Heat or Refining</strong></h3>
                                <p>Now, here’s where the magic truly happens.</p>
                                <p>We extract our Virgin Coconut Oil using the wet-processing method — not by drying the copra or heating it, but by cold-extracting the oil directly from fresh coconut milk.</p>
                                <p>The Arshith Fresh Process:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li> Fresh coconut meat is grated and cold-pressed to extract milk</li>
                                    <li> The milk is left to settle naturally in a clean, cool environment</li>
                                    <li> Slowly, without any interference, the pure oil separates and rises to the top</li>
                                    <li> This is scooped, filtered gently, and bottled — untouched by machines or chemicals</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>No heat. No bleach. No deodorizing.</p>
                                <p>Just pure, raw, unrefined coconut oil, the way nature gives it.</p>
                                
                                <h3>🚫 <strong>What You’ll Never Find in Our Bottle</strong></h3>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>❌ No preservatives</li>
                                    <li>❌ No mineral oil or palm oil</li>

                                </ul>
                                <p>What you will find is a crystal-clear, mild, and naturally aromatic oil that you can eat, apply, or light a lamp with.</p>
